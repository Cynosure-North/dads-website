				<h2>Kia ora, </h2>
				<h2>Iâ€™m<br>David North.</h2>
				<p>
					Iâ€™ve lived in Nelson since 2002, where my wife Alison and I raised our two children. Iâ€™ve worked as
					an
					airline pilot for over 25 years, and Iâ€™m also a passionate musician. I play in the <a
						href="https://www.nso.nz">Nelson Symphony Orchestra</a> and enjoy being part of our local arts community.
					<br>
					<br>
					Iâ€™m standing for council because I care deeply about our future. I want to help build an inclusive,
					thriving and sustainable Nelson, where families feel supported, the city centre is full of life, and
					decisions are made with the next generation in mind. Iâ€™d be honoured to represent you.

		<h1>WHY VOTE FOR ME?</h1>
		<p>
			Iâ€™m used to working collaboratively to achieve goals â€” whether itâ€™s a safe flight or a successful concert.

			With a background in science, I understand the long-term context of climate change and the urgent need to rethink how we manage transport, energy, and food production.

			Weâ€™re no longer in the dark about our impact on the planet. The cost of inaction wonâ€™t fall on us, but on our children and grandchildren. Thatâ€™s why I believe in practical, meaningful changes that reduce our footprint without compromising quality of life.</p>

		<h2>Some of the small but significant steps we can take include:</h2>

		<p> - Supporting alternative and active forms of transport
			- Encouraging solar panels and energy efficiency in new builds
			- Ensuring homes are well-insulated and future-ready
			- Exploring alternative fuels to reduce the impact of personal transport, while still preserving the cultural heritage of classic cars and bikes. </p>

		<h2>This next Council term will be a time of big decisions and real change. More than ever, we need councillors who:</h2>

		<p> - Understand the complexities of the challenges ahead
			- Communicate clearly and listen deeply
			- Lead with empathy and experience
			- Put the well-being of people and the planet at the heart of every decision
		</p>

		<h2>I believe in quality of life over standard of living. That means:</h2>

		<p> - Safe, vibrant communities
			- Clean rivers and beaches to swim in
			- National parks to explore
			- Active city centres full of creativity, sport and connection

			These are the treasures of Aotearoa â€” and especially of WhakatÅ« Nelson.

			Donâ€™t vote for me if youâ€™re looking for simple solutions to complex problems. They donâ€™t exist â€” and anyone saying otherwise isnâ€™t being honest.

			Vote for me if you want someone who is balanced, experienced, and genuinely committed to doing the work needed to protect and enhance our region for generations to come.
